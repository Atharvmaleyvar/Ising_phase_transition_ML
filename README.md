# Learning Phase Transitions in the 2D Ising Model Using Machine Learning

This project simulates the 2D Ising model using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm and applies machine learning (both unsupervised and supervised) to detect and learn phase transitions in statistical physics systems.

## Dataset

- The dataset is generated dynamically by running `main.py`.
- Files are saved as `.npy` arrays of shape `(N, N)` where each value is either `+1` or `-1` (spin).
- File naming format: `T{temperature}_step{step}.npy`, e.g., `T2.30_step12.npy`

---

## Dependencies

Install all required packages with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn torch

ðŸš€ How to Run

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Generate Spin Data

From the project root directory:

python main.py

This will:
	â€¢	Run Monte Carlo simulations at various temperatures
	â€¢	Save spin configurations in data/
	â€¢	Run unsupervised PCA + t-SNE + k-Means clustering

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Visualize Results

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook visualizations/analysis.ipynb

This shows:
	â€¢	PCA and t-SNE plots of phase-separated configurations
	â€¢	Color-coded by temperature

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: (Optional) Train Supervised Classifier

python -m ml_models.supervised

This will:
	â€¢	Train a CNN to classify configurations based on temperature
	â€¢	Use torch and cross-entropy loss on synthetic labels

Techniques Used

Physics Side:
	â€¢	2D Ising Model (L x L lattice)
	â€¢	Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo
	â€¢	Statistical mechanics concepts like magnetization, energy

ML Side:
	â€¢	Unsupervised: PCA, t-SNE, k-Means clustering
	â€¢	Supervised: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
	â€¢	Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering to detect phase transition around critical temperature (~2.27)

â¸»

 Notes
	â€¢	Make sure all .py folders have an __init__.py file so theyâ€™re recognized as modules.
	â€¢	If you encounter a path error, verify that you are running main.py from the root of the project.
	â€¢	The critical behavior of the Ising model is best captured near T â‰ˆ 2.27 (in units of J/kB).
